## Environment

- OS: `MacOS`
- nodejs: `v20.8.1`
- npm: `10.3.0`
- pnpm: `8.14.3`

## Installation

```
npm i -g pnpm
```

```
git clone https://github.com/KresimirCosic/nx-ng-book-administration.git
```

```
cd nx-ng-book-administration
```

```
pnpm i
```

## Start the app

Start the `json-server` instance (the `_db.json` file is there just to backup the data):

```
npx json-server --port 9229 server/db.json
```

To start the development server run `nx serve nx-ng-book-administration` (probably prefix with `npx` if CLI not installed globally) or just run regular Angular `start` command. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

## Observations

- Angular has changed a lot in the last couple of years, I am not a big fan of `standalone` components as it completely tries to evade the structural organization of modules (following the route of Vue and React for some reason).

- Testing has changed from Karma to Jest by default (no idea why, why not evade Jest in general then and go with Vitest since it's better). I am unsure why there is no browser instance when writing tests like before (even though I failed that part).

- Unsure about the JWT functionality how is that achieveable via `json-server`.
